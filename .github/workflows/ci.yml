# Continuous Integration for slirc-proto
#
# Runs on every push to main and on all pull requests.
# Two parallel jobs:
#   - test: Format, lint, and test on stable Rust
#   - msrv: Verify compilation on minimum supported Rust version (1.70)
#
# Design decisions:
#   - Linux only: Pure Rust library with no platform-specific code
#   - No nightly: No nightly features used
#   - No caching: Builds complete in <30s, caching adds complexity
#   - No coverage: Low value for protocol parser
#
